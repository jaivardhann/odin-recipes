    <h2> Description</h2>
    <p> Diet Coke is one of the best drinks available on the planet. It has zero calories 
        and tastes just as good as regular coke. The claims that it will cause cancer are
        stupid. In fact they have recieved a score of 10 on the stupidity scale made by
        Neeraj Pepsu.<br>

    <p> I dont even drink water anymore. Water is an inferior drink and it is a disrespect
        to your body to even try and put water in it. Diet Coke is the only drink
        you should be drinking. It is the best drink ever made, so good that it was provided
        to the survivers of 911 because it turned out to be an "anti PTSD" drink.
        It is so good that it was even used to treat the soldiers in Vietnam.
